Quickupdate is a script for updating Debian-based distrobutions.

The script verifies the presence of `apt`, `flatpak`, and `snap` on the system and proceeds to install updates from known package managers.

To install and use this script, run:
```
wget -O /usr/local/bin/quickupdate https://aleksiaksu.github.io/quickupdate/quickupdate && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/quickupdate
quickupdate
```
